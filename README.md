# hello-world
freeCodeCamp challenge

I am currently working as a freelancer "full-stack Ruby on Rails developer."  In my past life I worked as a physicist with a strong computer programming bent.  I became acquainted with Ruby on Rails via an EdX course and developed my skills to the point that I was hired as a freelancer.  I am interested in freeCodeCamp for a couple of reasons: (1) to deepen my understanding of javascript and front-end development and (2) to learn about the freeCodeCamp experience to see if I could recommend it to others who are seeking to further their careers.
